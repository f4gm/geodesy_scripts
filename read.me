These scripts were made in order to optimize some operations that we did in Excel for the Geodesy Geometry course:
- area.py: Calculates the area of the parallel segment given by two points.
- curvature_main_normal_segments.py: Calculates the radius of curvature of the principal segments.
- geodesic2rectangular.py: Convert ellipsoidal or geodesic coordinates to coordinates given an ellipsoid.
- inverse_puissant_dms.py: Calculates the geodesic line and azimuth (measured from south) between two points.
- meridian_arc.py: Calculates the radius of curvature of the meridian arc.
- parallel_arc.py: Calculates the radius of curvature of the parallel arc.
- puissant.py: Calculates the ellipsoidal coordinates given the geodesic line and the azimuth between two points.
I hope these scripts are useful for you.
